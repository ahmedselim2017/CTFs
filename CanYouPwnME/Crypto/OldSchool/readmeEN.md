# Crypto - OldSchool (50 Points)

## Description:

	Text: cfxdigthdppymtdbqyz
	Key: TBCXRL

## Solution:

There is a text a key so it should be a Vig√©nere cipher. So we should successfully
decrypt using [this](https://cryptii.com/)  site and get another decrypted text which is `jevgrvagbsyntsbezng`.  So we could decrypt it with same site and ROT13 algorithm. And we found the flag!

## Flag:
    cypwn_{writeintoflagformat}
